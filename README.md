# freecrime Profile Template

hey, this is a simple, clean profile page template i made for myself and decided to share. it's got that dark glassy vibe with a little overlay click-to-start thing (for background music if you want it), volume control, and some nice hover effects.

feel free to fork this repo, copy the code, and make it your own. edit whatever you want – colors, layout, add stuff, remove stuff, no rules here.

**quick disclaimer**  
original design & code by freecrime 
you're totally allowed to use this for your personal profile page and tweak it however you like.  
if you're new to html/css and need help: hit up our discord (link in github bio @ github.com/freecrime) or just ask an ai – yeah they have a bad rep sometimes but they get the job done with this stuff

### quick start
1. copy the `index.html` file
2. open it in your browser to see the default template
3. replace the placeholders:
   - your username in `<h1 class="name">`
   - bio text
   - location
   - add your real links (discord, github, whatever) with proper svgs
   - upload your pfp (gif works great) and link it in the avatar div
4. if you want background music or a blurred bg image:
   - upload your files to github releases (in this repo or your own)
   - use the direct download links in the code (uncomment the audio source or add the bg url)

### tips for assets (pfp, music, background)
github releases are the best way to get stable links that won't break later.  
example:  
`https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/releases/download/v1/pfp.gif`

way cleaner than raw github links.

### future stuff
this template might get some small updates here and there depending on feedback i get.  
if y'all want extras like an embedded discord widget, a little media player, more badge styles, whatever – just lmk in discord or open an issue. i'll probably add them if they fit the vibe.

Have Fun!
