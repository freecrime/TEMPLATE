# freecrime Profile Template

hey, this is a simple, clean profile page template i made for myself and decided to share. it's got that dark glassy vibe with a little overlay click-to-start thing (for background music if you want it), volume control, and some nice hover effects.

i originally wanted to turn this into a hosted site like fakecrime (that's why some older profiles still have those kinda pointless "admin" or "staff" badges), but in the end i decided to just go fully free and open. there's really no easy-to-use, clean, and actually free alternative out there to stuff like guns.lol or fakecrime.bio, so here we are – no signups, no paywalls, just copy and go.

yes ik guns.lol has a "free" option but let's be real – it looks kinda like a bootleg of fakecrime, and fakecrime itself is 4 euros unless you get invited (and even then you get that ugly "made by fakecrime" footer unless you pay extra). no thanks, i'd rather keep it clean and free for everyone.

**important note**  
we're not associated with fakecrime.bio or guns.lol in any way, and we don't plan on making any profit off this little bio project. "freecrime" is just a humorous name – we think fakecrime's aesthetic is pretty cool (well... mostly, some users there have kinda questionable taste lmao) and wanted to make something similar but definitely not a carbon copy.

feel free to fork this repo, copy the code, and make it your own. edit whatever you want – colors, layout, add stuff, remove stuff, no rules here.

### hosting options
you got two ways to get this live:

1. **host it yourself** → enable GitHub Pages on your own repo  
   you'll get a clean link like `yourusername.github.io` (or `yourusername.github.io/your-repo` if you want)  
   full control, super simple, takes like 2 minutes

2. **let us host it for you** → join our discord and just ask  
   we'll add it under `freecrime.github.io/yourusername`  
   if you go this route we'll help set everything up exactly how you want it (pfp, music, custom stuff, whatever)

either way works, up to you!

**quick disclaimer**  
original design & code by freecrime 
you're totally allowed to use this for your personal profile page and tweak it however you like.  
if you're new to html/css and need help: hit up our discord (link in github bio @ github.com/freecrime) or just ask an ai – yeah they have a bad rep sometimes but they get the job done with this stuff lol  
we're not responsible for anything people make with this template outside of profiles hosted on our github (freecrime.github.io).

### quick start
1. copy the `index.html` file
2. open it in your browser to see the default template
3. replace the placeholders:
   - your username in `<h1 class="name">`
   - bio text
   - location
   - add your real links (discord, github, whatever) with proper svgs
   - upload your pfp (gif works great) and link it in the avatar div
4. if you want background music or a blurred bg image:
   - upload your files to github releases (in this repo or your own)
   - use the direct download links in the code (uncomment the audio source or add the bg url)

### tips for assets (pfp, music, background)
github releases are the best way to get stable links that won't break later.  
example:  
`https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/releases/download/v1/pfp.gif`

way cleaner than raw github links.

### future stuff
this template might get some small updates here and there depending on feedback i get.  
if y'all want extras like an embedded discord widget, a little media player, more badge styles, whatever – just lmk in discord or open an issue. i'll probably add them if they fit the vibe.

Have Fun!
